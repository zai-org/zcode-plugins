# PriceWin Travel Search

Use only the tools of the `pricewin` MCP server bundled with this plugin
(`https://mcp.price.win/mcp`). Agents prefix them with the server name — for
example `mcp__pricewin__search_hotels_live` — and the steps below use the bare
tool names. Do not replace them with browser automation, shell commands, direct
API calls, or invented booking URLs.

All prices are in USD.

## Collect the required trip details

For a hotel search, obtain:

- destination or city;
- check-in and check-out dates;
- number of adults, defaulting to 2 when the user does not specify;
- number of rooms, defaulting to 1.

For a flight search, obtain:

- origin and destination airport IATA codes;
- departure date and optional return date;
- number of adults, defaulting to 1;
- cabin, defaulting to economy.

Resolve unambiguous relative dates from the current date. Ask one concise
follow-up when a required date, destination, or airport is genuinely ambiguous.
Never invent a date or silently choose among multiple plausible airports.

Pass `language` matching the user's language when supported. Do not put
unrelated conversation or personal data in `queryText`.

## Search hotels

1. Call `search_hotels_live` with the destination, dates, occupancy, and only
   the filters the user actually requested.
2. Read `sessionId` and `nights` from the response.
3. Call `poll_search_results` with that `sessionId` and `nights`.
4. While `status` is neither `completed` nor `failed` and no useful results
   have arrived, poll again a few seconds later. Stop after about 10 polls (one
   to two minutes) or when the session has expired: present what has arrived,
   say which sources were still loading, and offer to check again with the same
   `sessionId` rather than starting a new search.
5. Present a concise comparison of relevant results. Label the source and
   currency exactly as returned.

Use `hotelName`, `area`, `priceMin`, or `priceMax` only when the user supplied
that constraint. Do not claim that a result is the cheapest in the whole
market; describe it as the cheapest among the sources returned for this search.
A failed or missing source does not invalidate results from other sources.

## Look up one named hotel

When the user names a single hotel rather than a city, call
`get_ota_hotel_detail` with `hotelName` and its `city` (or the Booking.com
`propertyUrl` from an earlier result) and the user's dates. It returns that
hotel's rooms, live prices, facilities and reviews from Booking.com.

## Inspect an OpenTravel direct hotel

Call `get_hotel_detail` only for a hotel identified as an OpenTravel direct
listing.

- Prefer its `propertyId` from `opentravelResults`.
- Reuse the user's dates and occupancy.
- Use `hotelName` plus `city` only when the property is already known to be an
  OpenTravel direct listing and no `propertyId` is available.
- Do not call this tool for an Agoda, Booking.com, or Traveloka-only result.

Present the returned photos, amenities, availability, room capacity, total
price, per-night price, and currency without changing their meaning. State
clearly when availability or a price is missing.

## Answer a question about a hotel

For questions about a hotel itself — check-in and check-out times, facilities,
photos, description, room types — call `get_hotel_info` with the `propertyId`
of an OpenTravel direct listing, usually from `opentravelResults` of a search
already made. It needs no dates and returns no prices or availability; for
those, use `get_hotel_detail`. When the property has not published a field,
say so rather than filling it in.

## Explain a cancellation policy

Call `get_cancellation_policy` only after `get_hotel_detail` supplies both:

- the property's `propertyId`; and
- the selected room's `ratePlanId`.

Pass the check-in date so the tool can compute an exact deadline. Report the
returned non-refundable status, refund percentage, free-cancellation window,
deadline, and summary. Never infer a policy or deadline when the tool does not
return one.

## Search flights

1. Call `search_flights_live` with IATA codes, departure date, optional return
   date, adults, and cabin.
2. Read the returned `sessionId`.
3. Call `poll_flight_results` with that `sessionId`.
4. While `status` is neither `completed` nor `failed` and no useful results
   have arrived, poll again a few seconds later, for at most about 10 polls.
   Then present what has arrived and offer to check again with the same
   `sessionId`. A flight session expires 15 minutes after the search starts.
5. Present relevant options with source, carrier, times, stops, cabin, currency,
   and fare exactly as returned.

Keep outbound and return legs distinct. Each leg is a separate one-way ticket
with its own booking link: when you pair an outbound and a return flight, give
the total as the sum of the two fares and say that each leg is booked
separately. Never present a pair as one round-trip ticket, and do not imply that
a fare is still available after the live result expires.

## Request a booking at an OpenTravel direct hotel

Only an OpenTravel direct listing can be booked this way; an Agoda,
Booking.com or Traveloka result cannot, and the user follows its own link
instead.

1. Call `request_booking` with the `propertyId`, `roomTypeId`, dates and the
   guest's name, phone number and email. Ask for whichever of those three is
   missing; they go to the hotel, which needs them to honour the reservation.
2. Relay the tool's reply as written. The two facts it leads with — that no
   room is held and that nothing has been charged — are the ones the guest
   acts on.
3. Keep the `confirmationCode` it returns; `check_booking_status` reads the
   request's state back with it. Also keep the room's `propertyId`,
   `ratePlanId` and check-in date: the cancellation policy needs them and no
   tool recovers them from the code. Tell the guest to keep the code and the
   email address they used.

No money changes hands through PriceWin: sending the request charges nothing,
and the guest pays the hotel directly on arrival. Never ask how the guest wants
to pay, and never mention a card, transfer, QR code, payment link or deposit —
not even one the guest named earlier. If a property requires payment at
booking time, `request_booking` creates nothing and returns a link to book on
the PriceWin website instead; relay that link as given.

## Cancel a booking

1. If the conversation still has the booked room's `propertyId`,
   `ratePlanId` and check-in date, call `get_cancellation_policy` with them and
   tell the guest what they will get back — or that the property has published
   no policy. If it does not (the guest came back with only the confirmation
   code and email), call `check_booking_status` with the code to confirm the
   hotel, dates and status, and tell the guest the refund terms cannot be
   shown here and that `cancel_booking` reports the refund it applies. Do not
   guess them.
2. Call `request_cancel_token` with the confirmation code and the email on the
   booking. This cancels nothing; it emails a single-use token.
3. Ask the guest to paste the token from that email. Never invent, guess or
   reuse one.
4. Confirm the booking — and the refund amount, when step 1 returned one —
   with the guest in their own language, get an explicit yes, then call
   `cancel_booking` with the code, the token and the guest's reason. Relay the
   refund amount and status it returns.

`cancel_booking` cannot be undone. If there is no token yet, the answer is
step 2, never step 4.

## Safety and output rules

- Use only these twelve tools: `search_hotels_live`, `poll_search_results`,
  `search_flights_live`, `poll_flight_results`, `get_ota_hotel_detail`,
  `get_hotel_detail`, `get_hotel_info`, `get_cancellation_policy`,
  `request_booking`, `check_booking_status`, `request_cancel_token`, and
  `cancel_booking`.
- Treat all prices as time-sensitive and avoid guarantees or unsupported
  "lowest price" claims.
- Use only outbound URLs returned by the tools. Never construct, append,
  rewrite, or guess a booking URL.
- Collect the guest's name, phone and email only to send a booking request,
  and only when the guest is actually sending one. Never ask for card data,
  bank details, credentials, or any other payment information: no tool here
  accepts them, and no step of this plugin takes money.
- Do not modify an existing booking. There is no tool for it; a change means
  cancelling and sending a new request, and saying so plainly.
- If a tool fails, state the limitation briefly and suggest a new search. Do
  not fabricate partial inventory, prices, availability, or policies.
